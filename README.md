# Roles

We have a identified a few roles within the project. Each individual and organizations involved in the project acts within one of these roles.

## Stewards

The current steward of the project is [Ace Centre](http://acecentre.org.uk/). Ace Centre currently delegates two individuals to act as stewards on their behalf. Currently the stewards are [Gavin Henderson](https://acecentre.org.uk/about/staff/gavin-henderson) and [Will Wade](https://acecentre.org.uk/about/staff/will-wade).

The expectations of stewards are as follows:

- To make sure maintainers and contributors have the tools to be successful
- To apply for new funding
- To make make clear the needs of the end users
- To make sure that project development is always moving towards current aims and goals
- To facilitate discussions about the direction of the project
- To regularly update everyone involved with the project about its current progress
- All the expectations of maintainers also apply

## Maintainer

The expectations of maintainers are as follows:

- Triage bug and feature requests
- Engage with discussions on Slack
- Create a welcoming environment for new contributors
- Enforce the [Code Of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md)

## Contributor

A contributor is anyone who contributes to the project. Contributions are not limited to code changes. Joining in a discussion, opening an issue, giving feedback and writing docs are all considered as 'contributions'.

Everyone is welcome as a contributor.

There are no expectations, other than all contributions must abide by the [Code Of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).

# Funding

Dasher Project, requires a significant amount of engineering resources to add new features and improve the project. Unfortunately we can not always rely on the generosity of engineers donating their free time, or outside companies donating their engineering resource.

Ace Centre will apply for funding on behalf of the Dasher Project. All funding received will be paid to Ace Centre who will then invest funds directly back into the Dasher Project.

When spending the funding we will always allow existing maintainers and contributors the opportunity to get paid in exchange for their time completing pre agreed work. If no existing maintainers or contributors are available to complete the work we will look for outside contractors to complete the work using the funding.

When appropriate Ace Centre will use some of the money to cover the cost of future time invested in the Dasher Project. When this is done it will be explicit. We will prioritize new features and development over covering our costs.

All funding received and spent will be done in a public manner. There will be open discussions about funding and spending on our communication channels. However, we will explicitly maintain a spending log for each financial year in this repository. See below the spending/funding logs:
